# Sinnoh-National-Pokedex-App
This is an app that contains all 493 Pokédex entries as in a Sinnoh National Pokédex in the original Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. You can use the search bar to filter for a specific Pokémon by entry number, but not by name. You are able to click on each Pokémon's entry and it will load a Pokemon's type, physical attributes, abilities and main stats. You may navigate to the next or previous entry by clicking on the left or right arrows next to the Pokémon's picture or click on the close arrow next to the Pokémon's name to navigate back to the Pokédex page (index.html). 

## Getting Started
### Installing
```
#Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Meako-Chan/Sinnoh-National-Pokedex-App.git
```
### Running Program
Simply run the program by navigating to index.html, then run with a live server. You are able to reveal it in browser, but this will most likely cause the imports for modules to fail as it will attempt to import modules from the wrong directory.
